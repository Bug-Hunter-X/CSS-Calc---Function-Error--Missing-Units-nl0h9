The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly in combination with other units. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will cause issues because the unit is missing from 10 (it should be `10px`, `10em`, etc.). This can lead to unexpected layout behaviors.
