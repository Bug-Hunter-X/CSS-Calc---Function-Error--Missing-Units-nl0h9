# CSS Calc() Function Error: Missing Units
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the CSS `calc()` function: omitting units in the calculation.  The `bug.css` file showcases the incorrect usage, leading to unexpected layout behavior. The `bugSolution.css` provides the correct implementation.

This is a subtle bug that can be difficult to track down.  Ensure all values within `calc()` have consistent units.
